    description: "Learn from the past, set vivid, detailed goals for the future,
      and live in the only moment of time over which you have any control: now.
      Optimism is the faith that leads to achievement. Nothing can be done without
      hope and confidence. If you can dream it, you can do it. Do it now, not tomorrow.
      Always continue the climb. It is possible for you to do."
